# front-and-back

Given your setup and the game concept you're building (a 2D rogue-like dungeon crawler with turn-based combat and social features), it's important to focus on performance, real-time interactions, and scalability while integrating it into the full-stack environment you're already familiar with.

Here's a breakdown of key tools and frameworks that will complement your current stack and help you build a performant, standards-compliant game:

---

### **1. Game Framework: Phaser**
Phaser is an excellent choice for the core game engine, especially for a 2D game with turn-based combat.
- **Why**: Phaser is lightweight, fast, and specifically designed for 2D games. It supports both WebGL and Canvas, allowing you to optimize performance across different devices.
- **Installation**: 
  ```bash
  npm install phaser
  ```
- **Integration with React**: You can use React for the game's UI (such as menus, lobbies, and social features) and Phaser for the core gameplay loop. Using `react-phaser` or wrapping Phaser in a custom hook could help integrate it smoothly with React.

---

### **2. State Management: React Query (@tanstack/react-query)** 
Since you're already using **React Query**, this is excellent for handling async operations like fetching game data, updating user progress, or interacting with a backend for player statistics or social features. It handles caching, synchronization, and background refetching, which can reduce the load on the server.
- **Why**: It integrates well with your existing React stack and is perfect for interacting with game data, such as leaderboard stats or player inventories.
- **Example**: Use it to manage user data, such as character stats, and allow them to sync with the backend while ensuring minimal network calls.

---

### **3. Real-time Communication: Socket.io**
To implement social features (like multiplayer chat or lobbies) and real-time interaction (e.g., dynamic dungeons or multiplayer elements), use **Socket.io** for handling WebSocket-based communication between the server and clients.
- **Why**: It's easy to integrate with **Express** (which you’re already using) and provides real-time, bidirectional communication with a low-latency experience.
- **Installation**:
  ```bash
  npm install socket.io
  npm install socket.io-client
  ```
- **Use Case**: Implement multiplayer interactions like real-time chat or notifications when a friend enters the game lobby. This would also work well for syncing player movements in shared spaces.

---

### **4. Authentication: Auth0 (Social Login)** 
Since you’re already using **@auth0/auth0-react**, continue using it for managing user authentication, including social logins (Google, Facebook, etc.), which are critical for user profiles in social games like Club Penguin or Animal Jam.
- **Why**: Auth0 can handle social logins easily, which is great for creating a seamless user experience where players can log in quickly and start customizing their characters or homes.
- **Use Case**: Leverage Auth0 to store and manage user data such as in-game achievements, custom homes, and player profiles.

---

### **5. Database Management: Knex with SQLite**
You’re already using **Knex** for SQL queries, and **SQLite** for the database. These are fine for development, but for production (especially in a multiplayer game), you may want to consider a more scalable option like **PostgreSQL**.
- **Why**: SQLite is lightweight, but PostgreSQL offers better scalability, particularly for handling multiple users, custom home inventories, and player stats.
- **Transition**: Keep **Knex** as it supports PostgreSQL, making it easier to migrate when scaling up.

---

### **6. User Interface (UI): React and Tailwind**
Since your game will include lobbies, customization, and interaction-heavy elements (e.g., chat, player profile editing), using **React** for the UI is a smart choice. You can use **Sass** for styling to create responsive and dynamic designs.
- **Why**: You're already using **React**, and they provide flexibility for building interactive UIs with less performance overhead compared to heavier frameworks.
- **Installation**:
- Steps to Switch to Tailwind CSS
- Install Tailwind CSS: First, remove any unnecessary Sass files and install Tailwind:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init
```

- Configure tailwind.config.js: Set up your config file to remove unused styles in production (purging CSS):

```js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

- Add Tailwind to your CSS: Replace your Sass imports with Tailwind's directives in index.css or App.css:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
- **Use Case**: Implementing character customization screens, home-building tools, and in-game menus using React's component model.

---

### **7. Backend API: Express & JWT**
Since you're using **Express** with **jsonwebtoken** and **express-jwt**, this setup works well for protecting routes and user-specific data, such as player stats and profiles.
- **Why**: JWT is secure and efficient for authenticating users, especially in a game where users can log in, save progress, and load custom data like inventory or homes.
- **Example**: Use JWT for securing API endpoints that handle sensitive operations like buying in-game items or saving dungeon progress.

---

### **8. Development Workflow: Vite + Esbuild**
Your current dev environment with **Vite** and **Esbuild** for bundling is great for fast development cycles and ensures quick rebuilds.
- **Why**: These tools are already optimized for performance, especially important in fast iteration during game development.
- **Integration**: Continue using Vite for building both the game and the React components, and Esbuild for fast bundling.

---

### **9. Testing: Vitest & Testing Libraries**
For ensuring game functionality and performance, you're already using **Vitest** and **@testing-library/react**.
- **Why**: These are solid choices for testing React components and game logic. Vitest, in particular, is compatible with Vite, which ensures fast test execution.
- **Use Case**: Write tests to ensure character stats are saved correctly, interactions like dungeon progress are handled, and social features like chat and multiplayer sync work as expected.

---

### **10. Deployment and Scalability:**
Once you're ready for production, consider:
- **Heroku or Vercel**: For quick deployment of your full-stack app.
- **AWS or DigitalOcean**: For more complex, scalable game hosting with database support, WebSocket scaling, and microservices.

---

### **Final Recommendations**:
- **Stick with Phaser** for your core game mechanics.
- **React** will handle UI and social elements like lobbies and chat.
- **Socket.io** is essential for real-time multiplayer interactions.
- **Auth0** remains a strong authentication solution.
- **Knex/SQLite** is good for initial development, but PostgreSQL may be necessary for production scalability.
- **React Query** will handle game data fetching and synchronization.

These tools and frameworks fit well with your current setup and can help you build a performant, modern web game with social interaction elements.
